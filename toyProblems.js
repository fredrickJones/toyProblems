//“Write a function called finder that accepts two parameters, the first one is a string and the second is an array. Have your function return true if the string is found in the array and false if it is not”
//var nums = [“hello”, “javascript”, “awesome”];
//finder(“javascript”, nums); //true
//finder(“lame”, nums); //false

//CODE HERE




// Write a function called combinator that is given two arrays as arguments. The first array is an array of first names, and the second array is an array of last names. Have the function return a new array combining the first names and the last names.

// combinator([‘Tyler’, ‘Ean’, ‘Cahlan’], [‘McGinnis’, ‘Platter’, ‘Sharp’]); →
// [‘Tyler McGinnis’, ‘Ean Platter’, ‘Cahlan Sharp’];

//CODE HERE




// “Make the function invocation work”
// sum([1,4,3,5,2,8], function(total){
// 	return ‘The total sum of the array is ‘ + total;
// });

//CODE HERE




// Write a function that takes an array and replaces all of the odd numbers with the letter ‘O’. 

//CODE HERE




//Write a function called Reverse that takes in a string and reverses that string without using .reverse on the Arrays prototype.

//CODE HERE




//Factorial: Write a function that takes in a number and returns the factorial of that number . Ex: factorial(5) returns 120 because 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 === 120

//CODE HERE




// Write a Function called simpleSymbols that takes in a string parameter and determines if it is an acceptable sequence by either returning the string true or false. The str parameter will be composed of + and = symbols with several letters between them (ie. ++d+===+c++==a) and for the string to be true each letter must be surrounded by a + symbol. So the string to the left would be false. The string will not be empty and will have at least one letter. 

//CODE HERE




// Given an arbitrary input string, return the first non-repeated character in the string. For example:
// firstNonRepeatedCharacter(‘ABA’); // => ‘B’
// firstNonRepeatedCharacter(‘AABCABD’); // => ‘C’

//CODE HERE
